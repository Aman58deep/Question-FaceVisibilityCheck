" Project Task: Face Position Validator in React

  Objective:
  Create a React application that validates whether a person is sitting properly in front of the webcam with their facial traits clearly visible. If the person is positioned correctly, route the user to the home page of the application.

  Guideline:
  1. It is a front end based project and therefore backend is required to be made separately. 
  2. You can use Opensource Api's for the completion of the task.
  3. If you are a fullstack developer and want to create the your backend for it then you can proceed with that.
  4. The app should be based upon dynamic resolution.
"
The Face details are fetched using ml5's face api and the capture element for webcam input is prepared using p5.js's createCapture functionality (which creates a dom video element with wem cam input into it.
The home page here is a peek on my freelancing profile on fiverr.

Submission:
1. Upload the code in github public repository and keep the share the link ready.
2. Create a demonstration video, upload it in google drive and keep the share the link ready.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
